      <p>This is my recent vacation to Las Vegas. It was my 5th yr wedding anniversary,
         and one of the best trips I've been on. We tried new things, stepped out of our comfort zone, fell deeper into
         our connection with one another and had an awesome time. We can't wait to go back!</p>

      <p>We went to the Red Canyon. Which is absolutely breathtaking. We took a 13 mile one way drive through the
         Canyon which takes you to different areas in the canyon to hike and walk through. It was an extermely
         hot day as expected in Las Vegas in May. But the tour was worth staying in the heat. We came across a snake
         that scared us right back to our cars! What amazed me the most was the silence of the canyon. It's a moment
         you can expereince to sit in the silence and be present. There's nothing like it.

      <h2>The Rail Explorers</h2>

      <p>Pedal powered rail vehicles date back to at least the 1850’s, when maintenance workers used hand-cars and
      ‘rail bikes’ to travel along the tracks. They were used to transport crew and materials for track inspection and repairs. 
      Today, there are a variety of designs in use around the world: the ‘Draisine’ of Europe; ‘rail bikes’ with aluminum frames and plastic wheels; 
      and modified road bikes with an outrigger wheel.</p>

      <h2>STK Steakhouse</h2>
      <p>STK is one of the many restaurants located inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We came here for our anniversary dinner and the food was delicious. 
      We ordered the short rib with mac & cheese and veggies. The ambiance was very romanitc, the drinks were really unique and the food was unforgettable.
